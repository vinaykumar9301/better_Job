# Deploying Node.js App to Kubernetes

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Node.js application to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker. The process involves Dockerizing the application, creating a Kubernetes deployment, and exposing it through a service.

## Steps

### 1. **Dockerize the Node.js Application**

To begin, create a `Dockerfile` that defines how to build the Docker image for the Node.js app. This file should set up the working environment, install dependencies, and specify how the application will run inside the Docker container.

### 2. **Build the Docker Image**

Once the `Dockerfile` is set up, build the Docker image by running the appropriate Docker commands. This will package your application and its dependencies into a portable image that can be deployed on any platform.

### 3. **Push the Docker Image to a Container Registry**

To deploy the Docker image to Kubernetes, you need to push it to a container registry, such as Docker Hub. After logging in to your Docker Hub account, tag your image and push it to the registry.

### 4. **Create Kubernetes Deployment and Service**

Define the Kubernetes configuration in a `kube.yml` file. This configuration includes a deployment to specify the number of replicas and the image to be used, as well as a service to expose the application to the outside world.

### 5. **Apply the Kubernetes Configuration**

Once the `kube.yml` file is ready, use Kubernetes' `kubectl apply` command to deploy the application to the cluster. This command will create the necessary resources and make the app available on the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. **Access the Application**

After applying the configuration, check the status of your pods and services using `kubectl`. When the service is ready (and if using a LoadBalancer), you will be able to access the Node.js app through the external IP provided by the service.
